\arguments{
\item{x, y}{A pair of data frames, data frame extensions (e.g. a tibble), or
lazy data frames (e.g. from dbplyr or dtplyr). See \emph{Methods}, below, for
more details.}

\item{by}{As in \pkg{dplyr}, but extended so user can supply a formula or a list
of character and formulas. Formulas are used for fuzzy joins, see dedicated
section below.}

\item{copy}{Ignored at the moment because \pkg{powerjoin} doesn't support databases}

\item{suffix}{If there are non-joined duplicate variables in \code{x} and
\code{y}, these suffixes will be added to the output to disambiguate them.
Should be a character vector of length 2.}

\item{keep}{A boolean for compatibility with \pkg{dplyr}, or a value among "left",
"right", "both", "none" or "default". See dedicated section below.}

\item{na_matches}{Should two \code{NA} or two \code{NaN} values match?
\itemize{
\item \code{"na"}, the default, treats two \code{NA} or two \code{NaN} values as equal, like
\code{\%in\%}, \code{\link[=match]{match()}}, and \code{\link[=merge]{merge()}}.
\item \code{"never"} treats two \code{NA} or two \code{NaN} values as different, and will
never match them together or to any other values. This is similar to joins
for database sources and to \code{base::merge(incomparables = NA)}.
}}

\item{check}{A list created with \code{check_specs()}}

\item{conflict}{A function, formula, the special value amongst \code{"patch"},
or a named list of such items. If the LHS of the formula is \code{rw} the rhs will
be applied rowwise. Note that the columns will be subset with \code{[} so for
list columns \code{.x} or \code{.y} will refer to length 1 lists and you might sometimes
need \code{.x[[1]]} or \code{.y[[1]]}.}

\item{fill}{Values used to replace missing values originating in unmatched keys,
or a named list of such items.}
}
\value{
A data frame
}
\description{

\section{\code{keep} argument values}{

\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default) : merge keys and name them as the left table's keys, and
keep columns used for fuzzy joins from both tables
\item \code{left} : keep only key columns for left table
\item \code{right}: keep only key columns for right table
\item \code{both} or \code{TRUE}: keep key columns from both tables, adding suffix if relevant
\item \code{none} : drop all key columns from the output
\item \code{FALSE} : merge keys and name them as the left table's keys, maps to \code{none} for fuzzy joins
}
}

\section{fuzzy joins}{


To specify fuzzy matching conditions we use formulas in which we refer to
the columns from the left side data frame using \code{.x} and the right side data frame
using \code{.y}, for instance \code{by = ~ .x$col1 > .y$col2}.

We can specify several conditions and even mix equi condition with fuzzy condition,
for instance \code{by = c(col1 = "col2", ~ .x$col3 > .y$col4)}

To fuzzy match strings we can leverage the functions from the \pkg{stringr}
package since they are vectorized on all main arguments,
for instance to match observations where \code{col1} contains \code{col1} we can attach
\pkg{stringr} and do \code{by =  ~ str_detect(.x$col1, fixed(.y$col2))}.

Another useful function is \code{stringdist} from the \pkg{stringdist} package to match
strings that are close enough, for instance \code{by = ~ stringdist::stringdist(.x$a,.y$a) < 2}

We can also define a new column computed during the fuzzy matching, using the
arrow assignment operator, for instance : \code{by = ~ .x$col1 > (mysum <- .y$col2 + .y$col3)}

When the \code{by} condition evaluates to \code{NA} the observation is dismissed. This makes
\code{by = c(a = "b")} slightly different from \code{by = ~ .x$a == .y$b} when \code{na_matches}
is \code{"na"} (the default). To be able to match \code{NA} with \code{NA} in fuzzy matching condition
we can use the \verb{\%==\%} operator (bone operator), defined in this package.
